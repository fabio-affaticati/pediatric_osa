## 1. Abstract:

Childhood obesity is one of the most important public health challenges of the 21th century, since it increases the risk of obesity at adult age and its associations with several comorbidities. Obesity is also a well-known risk factor for developing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is characterized by repeated episodes of breathing pauses (apneas and hypopneas) during sleep caused by upper airway obstruction resulting in intermittent hypoxia (IH), increased arousals from sleep and sleep fragmentation. In the general pediatric population the prevalence of OSA is estimated around 2-3%, however OSA can be present in 13 to 60% of children with obesity. Similar to obesity, OSA is independently associated with important morbidity, mostly involving the cardiovascular and metabolic systems. 
Obesity is characterized by a state of chronic inflammation. Increasing evidence points to a critical role of adipose tissue hypoxia in mediating the proinflammatory responses seen in obesity, which leads to systemic inflammation. In contrast, OSA is characterized by repeated cycles of hypoxia and reoxygenation, which create a characteristic pattern of nocturnal IH. This IH is seen as one of the important drivers behind the comorbidities associated with OSA as it activates the sympathetic nervous system and promotes systemic inflammation. Indeed, intermittent hypoxia in animal models exacerbates vascular dysfunction and reproduces glucose and lipid homeostasis disturbances similar as those seen in patients with OSA. 
As both OSA and obesity lead to similar cardiovascular and metabolic consequences, and with increasing evidence suggesting a potential synergistic effect, it has been hypothesized that OSA shares various pathophysiological mechanisms of cardiometabolic complications with obesity16. Because obesity and OSA activate similar pathways, it is difficult to determine how OSA can exacerbate the obesity-related comorbidities. Whole blood gene expression analysis could shed more light on the underlying pathophysiology of OSA, independent of obesity, and suggest possible biomarkers. Therefore, the aim of this study was to better understand the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in OSA in children with obesity through whole blood mRNA sequencing.
